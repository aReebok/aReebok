### Hi there 👋


**aReebok/aReebok** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some discord bots and a text-based game!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust, docker, and k8s.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on discord bots, game dev, and robotics.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with game dev and ascii art making.
- 💬 Ask me about how I make my shin ramen.
- 📫 How to reach me: kahnareeba@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to collect a lot of mementos. Went to six flags with me? Yea I probably kept the ticket. Name tags for speech and debate competitions? You bet I've got some in the box. Too cruel to throw it away now.
